Hello!

Welcome to my project. Thanks for taking the time to review.

This is a travel app that takes a destination and a date and return the current weather or the historical weather and an image related to the location.

It works by assessing the place inputted and converts them into coordinates via the geonames api. It then takes those coordinates and gets the weather via the weatherbit api. From there, the info from weather bit helps the pixabay api grab the city name and display a related image to the user interface.
